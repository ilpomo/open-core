# open-core: neuron-based processing framework

> Code has to run like the human brain, trillions of individual neurons firing off messages to each other, a massively 
> parallel network with no central control, no single point of failure, yet able to solve immensely difficult problems. 
> And itâ€™s no accident that the future of code looks like the human brain, because the endpoints of every network are, 
> at some level, human brains.

`open-core` is an event-based processing framework for Python software.
It helps build massively parallel, concurrent, and asynchronous code that follows the [actor model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model) paradigm: 
multiple independent asynchronous process services emitting and receiving events to and from each other, without the 
need of a central broker or coordinator.
It tries to achieve this in the most intuitive, simple, and straightforward possible way.

## Design

- Designed over [the actor model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model)
  - Parallelism through multi-processing for CPU bound tasks
  - Concurrency based on multi-threading for I/O bound tasks
  - Concurrency based on Asyncio for network-related tasks
  - Asynchronous [ZeroMQ](https://github.com/zeromq/pyzmq) contexts and sockets

## Installation

```sh
pip install open-core
```

## Dependencies

`open-core` will always try to reduce dependencies to the extreme minimum. The current dependencies are specified in 
the `requirements.txt` file::

- [msgspec](https://github.com/jcrist/msgspec): A fast serialization and validation library, with builtin support for JSON, MessagePack, YAML, and TOML.
- [PyZMQ](https://github.com/zeromq/pyzmq): Python bindings for ZeroMQ.
- [Pytest](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest): The pytest framework makes it easy to write small tests, yet scales to support complex functional testing.

### Installing dependencies through the requirements.txt file

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
